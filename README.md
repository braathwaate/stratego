Introduction
------------

Java remake of stratego.  Forked from cjmalloy/stratego.
This version has an improved ai and other features.

Installation and Requirements
-----------------------------

Stratego requires java, which you probably already have or can
figure out how to download.

To run on most computers, just double click on the jar file to run.

If that doesn't work, you might need to
make the jar file executable
or set up your computer to select which program opens the jar file.

Finally, you can try to run it from the command line:

	java -jar stratego_v0.1.0.jar
